Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java Swing, offering a responsive GUI with intuitive gameplay. 
Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, with automatic win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns.
If all tiles are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie. Winning tiles highlight in green, while ties turn orange for visual feedback. 
The code leverages java.awt and javax.swing for the interface, with event handling for button clicks. 
To run, compile and execute TicTacToe.java (requires Java JDK 8+). Future enhancements could include a restart button, AI opponents, or a score tracker. 
Ideal for learning Swing, 2D arrays, and game logic!
